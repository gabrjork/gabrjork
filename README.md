hi! Iâ€™m gabriel, currently working in finance as an economist and just starting to incorporate coding into my analysis routine. 

here I plan to share some of my R scripts which have have proven quite useful to me, bearing in mind that they may not be the most optimized - I'm still learning, after all.
also, it may be worth mentioning that I jumped right into working in R via VSCode, not RStudio, so there could be some RStudio specific tools that I'm unaware of.

feel free to reach out about anything R related :)
